Excalidraw json files created for workshops that I facilitate on excalidraw.com

## Workshops:
**Inception**: workshop to kickoff new team to create Outcomes and output a prioritized set of items to be worked

The purpose of an "Inception" is to bring teams together to define the way forward for solving a specific Outcome or problem. The output of an Inception activity should be to gain mutual agreement and understanding on what is being proposed so that a prioritized backlog can be created and work can begin building the 'right thing' to meet the Stakeholders expectations.​

Successful Inceptions provide a clear understanding of the work and value being sought with teams often able to begin "hands on keyboard" work immediately upon completion of the event.

**Health checks**: (in-progress)
